* _Behavior: User enters a letter and another single letter and it tells you how many match
Input: o, o
Output: 1
I chose this as my simplest spec because we are just checking to see if the two letters match._

* _Behavior: User enters two letters and they dont match it doesnt count it
Input: a , b
Output: 0
I chose this as my next spec because we want to see if their second word match's the input word._

* _Behavior: User enters multiple character word  and another word and it will say if they match.
Input: bake, back
Output: 0
I chose this as the next spec because it seems like there isn't any simpler spec to preform before this one._
